# Kudomon GO!
Credit Kudos' Technical Challenge.

### The Plan:

* The app is simple so let's keep it simple. I could build it in pure ruby but for the sake of making things easier for myself I'll use sinatra (Rails is a bit on an over-kill).

* I will need two main classes `Creature/Kudomon class` and `Player/Trainer class` and a few smaller calsses:
```
.
+-- _Player/Trainer class
|
+-- _Creature/Kudomon class
|   +-- GrassType class
|       +--Sourbulb class
|   +-- FireType class
|       +--Mancharred class
|   +-- ElectricType class
|       +--Chikapu class
|   +-- WaterType class
|       +--PlopPlop class
|   +-- RockType class
|       +--Balboa class
|   +-- PsychicType class
|       +-- Neo class
.
```
